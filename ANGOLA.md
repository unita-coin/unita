### 1. Economic Growth and Diversification

-   **2024 GDP Growth**: Angola's economy grew by **4.4%** in 2024, marking the strongest expansion in a decade. Growth was driven by recovery in the oil sector and strong performance in mining, commerce, and agriculture. The economy has not yet fully recovered the **10.4% real GDP loss between 2016 and 2020**. ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/angola/publication/angola-economic-update-boosting-growth-with-inclusive-financial-development))
    
-   **2025 Outlook**: IMF projects a **3.8% growth rate** for 2025, supported by high international oil prices and recovery in hydrocarbons production. ([IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2025/02/24/pr-2541-angola-imf-executive-board-concludes-2024-article-iv-consultation))

-   **Formal Financial Inclusion**: As of 2022, formal financial inclusion stood at **40%**, with banked population at **36%**. ([FinMark Trust](https://finmark.org.za/Publications/2022_English_pocket_FinScope_Angola.pdf))
    
-   **Economic Challenges**: High inflation, public debt, oil-dependency (oil >90% of exports), and scarcity of foreign currency remain significant hurdles. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Angola))
